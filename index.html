          Why is it important to recommend specific diets for people with
          multiple health conditions?
        </button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          It is important to recommend specific diets for people with multiple
          health conditions because what we eat can have a significant impact on
          our health. Different health conditions may require specific dietary
          modifications to help manage symptoms and prevent further health
          complications. For example, individuals with high blood pressure may
          need to limit their sodium intake, while individuals with diabetes may
          need to manage their carbohydrate intake to help regulate blood sugar
          levels. Additionally, certain health conditions may have overlapping
          dietary recommendations. For example, a diet that is rich in fruits,
          vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can benefit
          individuals with multiple health conditions such as diabetes, heart
          disease, and obesity. By recommending specific diets for people with
          multiple health conditions, healthcare providers and registered
          dietitians can help individuals better manage their health and reduce
          their risk of further health complications. It can also help
          individuals feel more in control of their health and improve their
          overall quality of life. However, it is important to consult with a
          healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine the best
          diet plan for your specific needs and health status

        <button class="question-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">
          What are some misconceptions about obesity?
        </button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer4">
          Some misconceptions about obesity include the belief that it is solely
          a result of poor willpower or laziness, when in fact it is a complex
          condition influenced by a variety of factors such as genetics,
          environment, behaviour, and physiology. Additionally, weight is not
          always a reliable indicator of health, and individuals of all sizes
          deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.

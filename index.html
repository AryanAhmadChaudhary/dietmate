        <button class="question-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">Why is it important to recommend specific diets for people with multiple health conditions?</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">It is important to recommend specific diets for people with multiple health conditions because what we eat can have a significant impact on our health. Different health conditions may require specific dietary modifications to help manage symptoms and prevent further health complications. For example, individuals with high blood pressure may need to limit their sodium intake, while individuals with diabetes may need to manage their carbohydrate intake to help regulate blood sugar levels.
            Additionally, certain health conditions may have overlapping dietary recommendations. For example, a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can benefit individuals with multiple health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.
            By recommending specific diets for people with multiple health conditions, healthcare providers and registered dietitians can help individuals better manage their health and reduce their risk of further health complications. It can also help individuals feel more in control of their health and improve their overall quality of life. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine the best diet plan for your specific needs and health status</div>

        <button class="question-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">What are some misconceptions about obesity?</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">Some misconceptions about obesity include the belief that it is solely a result of poor willpower or laziness, when in fact it is a complex condition influenced by a variety of factors such as genetics, environment, behaviour, and physiology. Additionally, weight is not always a reliable indicator of health, and individuals of all sizes deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.</div>
